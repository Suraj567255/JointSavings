# Joint Savings Account using Smart Contract

This Solidity smart contract will automate the creation of joint savings account that accepts two user addresses. These addresses are then able to control a joint savings account. It uses ether management functions to implement a financial institution's requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. It has the ability to deposit and withdraw funds fron the account.
